### ðŸ¤– Obstacle Avoiding Robot

I built an autonomous robot using Arduino Uno and ultrasonic sensors to detect and avoid obstacles in real time. I worked mainly on the hardware setup, wiring the components and assembling the robot chassis. The control logic was programmed in C++ using the Arduino IDE. This project helped me understand embedded systems and sensor integration for robotics.

**Technologies:** Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic Sensors, L298N Motor Driver, C++ (Arduino IDE)
